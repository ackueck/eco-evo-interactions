Dr. Wilkins was offered to establish and lead an independent, free floating Max Planck Research Group by the Max Planck Society. The group will launch in March 2022. We are going to study animal-microbial interactions at evolutionary time scales. If you have questions about our research, if you would like to visit us or even join our group, do not hesitate to contact us. Looking forward to hearing from you!
