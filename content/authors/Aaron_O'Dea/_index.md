Research in Aaron's lab focuses on change in marine ecosystems over time, from millions of years ago to the recent past, present day and into the future. Environmental and ecological transformation of the Caribbean caused by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama and global climate changes over the last 10 million years provide a framework to unravel ecological and evolutionary processes in deep time. Human activity has also had a major impact on Caribbean life and this is revealed in young fossil records. By piecing together clues left by fossil coral, sponges, sharks, mollusks and fish, his lab members reconstruct baseline conditions to help guide Caribbean reef conservation and improve our understanding of fundamental biological processes. For more information on Aaron's research please see [his website](www.odealab.com), [his Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=fRRMQjoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works), and his [departmental website](https://stri.si.edu/scientist/aaron-odea). Finally, Aaron is also dedicated to the dissemination of science though popular writing (e.g., [A History of Life in 100 Fossils](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/240074/a-history-of-life-in-100-fossils-by-paul-d-taylor-and-aaron-odea/)), [comic books](www.panamartina.com), the development of educational tools, and collaboration with videographers and artists.
