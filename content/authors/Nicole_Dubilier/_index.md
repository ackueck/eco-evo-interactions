Prof. Dr. Nicole Dubilier is the Director of the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology (MPIMM) in Bremen, Head of the Symbiosis Department, and Professor for Microbial Symbiosis at the University of Bremen. She is an expert and world leader in the study of marine microbial symbioses in invertebrate hosts and chemosymbioses. Some of her ground-breaking contributions include (i) the first-time-use of a combined metaproteomic and metabolomic analysis to examine a multi-member bacterial symbiont community and its host; (ii) showing that hydrogen fuels chemosynthetic symbioses in deep-sea vent animals; (iii) providing the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of chemosynthetic symbionts of marine invertebrates; (iv) the first metagenomic analysis of an endosymbiotic microbial community in an eukaryote host; and (v) the first description of an endosymbiotic sulphur cycle in which a sulphate reducer and a sulphur oxidizer exchange sulphur compounds to the benefit of their hosts.

Nicole has been a dedicated mentor for Laetitia. Laetitia was originally hired as a postdoc in the Symbiosis Department at the MPIMM in Bremen but Nicole encouraged Laetitia to apply for group leader positions and her own funding. With Nicole's passionate support, Laetitia received a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship and was offered to start her own group at a Max Planck Institute of her choice within the first year after arriving in Bremen. It was not only Nicole but also many members of the Symbiosis Department who devoted some of their precious time to review Laetitia's applications and practice her interviews. As such, the Symbiosis Department is definitely a unique research environment in the world where some of the most exciting research is being done people try to go the extra mile to support each other. Within a short and eventful time, Nicole has become not only a mentor but also an academic mother and role model for Laetitia.
