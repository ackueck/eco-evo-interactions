<center>Our motivation for doing research is to move from correlation to causation in studies of host-microbe evolution.
As oceans undergo major changes due to human activities (for example ocean warming and acidification), understanding how animals and plants adapt to a changing environment is now more than ever one of the biggest questions in marine biology. To predict future responses, we can explore the past and use geological events, which provide valuable insights into adaptive mechanisms.<center> <p>&nbsp;</p>
<center>The formation of the Isthmus of Panam치, for example, separated a previous, ancient ocean and all of its marine life into the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. These two oceans have developed into very different habitats. Closely related populations that were separated by the Isthmus either went extinct or had to adapt to diverging environmental conditions. Therefore, the Isthmus system offers an ideal opportunity to explore drivers and processes of speciation, diversification, and adaptation through a convergent evolution framework.<center> <p>&nbsp;</p>
<center>Microorganisms, e.g., archaea, bacteria, viruses, or fungi, play a major role in host responses to environmental change because they can have significant effects on host health and fitness. In our team, we study the convergent evolution of a group of closely related hosts and their associated bacteria on both sides of the Isthmus of Panam치. We are comparing lucinid clam populations (Lucinidae) and their endosymbiotic bacterial chemosymbionts (Candidatus Thiodiazotropha) at the genomic and transcriptomic level across the Isthmus of Panam치. In doing so, we can learn how a dramatic allopatric speciation event affected host-microbe associations from genotype to phenotype.<center> <p>&nbsp;</p>
<center>We are convinced that microbial symbionts are the key for understanding niche partitioning in highly diverse habitats, host evolution, and ecosystem functioning. We have three major research axes:<center>

## I. What are the rates of molecular divergence and signatures of past adaptation in host and symbiont genomes?
Based on sequencing data, we are reconstructing the molecular divergence of eukaryotic hosts and their microbial partners after they were separated by the Isthmus of Panam치, and we are characterizing genes that facilitated survival in different habitats.

## II. What were the ecological conditions in the past and how did this affect host-microbe interactions?
Here, we are moving beyond genetic markers and using the fossil record to understand the biogeochemical past of a symbiosis. We are looking into the past to understand the future.

## III. How quickly can an animal-microbial system adapt to new conditions?
For this project, we are manipulating the symbiosis in the lab and creating new host-symbiont combinations. These will be exposed to different environments to induce short-term adaptation.
