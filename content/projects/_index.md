Our motivation for doing research is to move from correlation to causation in studies of host-microbe evolution. We have three major research axes:

## I. I.	What are the rates of molecular divergence and signatures of past adaptation in host and symbiont genomes?
Based on sequencing data, we are reconstructing the molecular divergence of eukaryotic hosts and their microbial partners after they were separated by the Isthmus of Panam√°, and we are characterizing genes that facilitated survival in different habitats.

## II. II.	What were the ecological conditions in the past and how did this affect host-microbe interactions?
Here, we are moving beyond genetic markers and using the fossil record to understand the biogeochemical past of a symbiosis. We are looking into the past to understand the future.

## III. How quickly can an animal-microbial system adapt to new conditions?
For this project, we are manipulating the symbiosis in the lab and creating new host-symbiont combinations. These will be exposed to different environments to induce short-term adaptation.
