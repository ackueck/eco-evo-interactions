Anna Carlotta K端ck has joined us to study nitrogen fixation in lucinid clam symbionts from different habitats in Central America.

On the 15th of September 2021, Ms. K端ck joined our team to work on a MarMic Master thesis. Until the official start of the Eco-Evolutionary Interactions Group in 2022, she will be hosted by Prof. Nicole Dubilier in the Symbiosis Department, supervised by Dr. Wilkins. We are going to quantify nitrogen fixation of lucinid symbionts in nitrogen-rich as well as nitrogen-limited habitats based on gene expression data. Ms. K端ck will also incubate clams in the lab and measure and visualize nitrogen fixation under experimental conditions. You can read more about Ms. K端ck and the progress of her work in [her profile](https://www.ecoevoint.ch/author/anna-carlotta-kuck/). <p>&nbsp;</p>
**Welcome Carlotta!**
