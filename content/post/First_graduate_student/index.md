On the first of June, Isidora Morel has officially started her Ph.D. She will be working on the evolution of lucinid clams and their bacterial chemosymbionts. Ms. Morel has already received a Masters degree at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology and she is a member of the MarMic program. Until the official start of the Eco-Evolutionary Interactions Group, Ms. Morel will be hosted by Prof. Nicole Dubilier in the Symbiosis Department, supervised by Dr. Wilkins. Welcome Isidora!
