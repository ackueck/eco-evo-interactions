This is the first post of the Eco-Evolutionary Interactions Group, a new free-floating Max Planck Research Group hosted by the [Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology](https://www.mpi-bremen.de/en/Home.html) in Bremen, Germany. We will launch in March 2022. Stay tuned for updates and available positions in this new research group led by Dr. Laetitia G.E. Wilkins.
