The [ISME Early Career Scientist Committee](https://www.isme-microbes.org/committee-uid), of which Dr. Laetitia G.E. Wilkins is a member, hosted a virtual conference #UnityInDiversity on 11 - 12 November 2020 to fill the void left when ISME18 in South Africa had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. #UnityInDiversity was fully virtual, interactive, free for everybody to attend, with a program of invited talks by top microbial ecologists from around the world!
